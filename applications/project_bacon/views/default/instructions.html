<h2>Welcome Friends!</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the Game of Bacon! A word guessing game. The goal is to guess a
    key word that makes a &#8220;path&#8221; of words from the key word to the
    target word by searching and linking words that have one letter difference
    from the previous linked word to the key word and the target word. This
    game is a variation of the
    <a href="https://oracleofbacon.org/index.php">Oracle of Bacon</a>.
    This game compares the characters of two strings to link words from the
    key word to the target word instead of actors and movies.
</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>
    In order to play, users must
    <a href="{{=URL('default', 'user', args=['login'])}}">log in</a> or
    <a href="{{=URL('default', 'user', args=['register'])}}">sign up</a>.
    Once logged in, users are able to create a game by
    selecting a target word from the
    <a href="{{=URL('default', 'wordlist')}}">word list</a>.
    To play, select a made game on the
    <a href="{{=URL('default', 'board')}}">board</a> page. While on a game
    page, users select and submit a key word. Upon submission the key word
    makes a path to the target word.
